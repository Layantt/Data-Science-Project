# Introduction:
Legal researchers and students often face difficulties in accessing simplified and structured versions of legal texts, especially when it comes to the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL), one of the most recent and significant regulations in Saudi Arabia.

The motivation behind this project is to provide an educational and structured resource that facilitates a clearer understanding of the PDPL. The project focuses on transforming the law into a Question–Answer (Q&A) format, making it a more practical and user-friendly reference.

The scope of the project includes collecting the latest version of the PDPL with all amendments and restructuring its articles into a retrievable Q&A format, without delving into technical or coding details. The main beneficiaries include law students, legal practitioners, academics, and developers of AI systems who require reliable legal datasets.
The PDPL was chosen due to its importance in strengthening digital governance and protecting individuals’ rights in the era of big data.

# objectives:
- Collect the articles of the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) from official and reliable sources.  
- Transform the legal articles into a clear and structured Question–Answer (Q&A) dataset.  
- Provide a validated dataset that can support legal education and research.  
- Enable future use of the dataset in applications such as Q&A systems and information retrieval.
